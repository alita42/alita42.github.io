    <p>When writing HTML code it is often useful to have two of the same element look and act differently. We can change their behavior in CSS, but the stylesheet needs to know which element you want to behave in which way. Thus, you give the two elements different attributes you can call in the stylesheet. There are two different attributes you can use for this. They are id and class. </p>
<p>Ids are best used as a way to pinpoint a single individual element. The attributes given to it in the stylesheet will only be applied to that specific element.</p>
<p>example: If you want all the text in one section to be centered, but not anywhere else, this is the code you would use.
<blockquote>"html:
<div id="example"></div>"
css:
#example {
text-align:center
}"</blockquote></p>
<p>If you would like several elements to behave similarly, you would use the class attribute. This way, you would only have to call the attribute once in the stylesheet and have all of your changes apply to all of the selected elements.</p>

<p>example: If you want all of your sections to have a grey background, this is the code you would use:
<blockquote>html:
<section class="example">
</section>
css:
.section {
background-color: grey
}</blockquote></p>
<p>Though technically, you could use these interchangeably, these are the best practices associated with each attribute. It saves code, time and effort. In order to not be defining every element individually, you would use the class attribute. If you only need one element to behave a specific way, you should use the id attribute. The name in quotes need not be anything in particular, just something you may remember and won't be confused for some other html or css command. You could give them all names of dead Presidents, and they would work just as well. </p>

      When I found out what version control was, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Writing papers and creative writing pieces
 in college (it was my minor), I would have several different versions of the same file, each with a different filename
(often something like Shakespeare Paper 1, Shakespeare Paper 2), and I could never easily tell what
the difference was between them. If I had been able to use Git to control those versions, my life would have been much
easier. Every time you commmit changes to a file, git asks you to make a commit message, summarizing the changes made.
All the changes are named and packaged with the file so that you can easily navigate between versions and track edits made.
This is particularly beneficial for programming. It makes it easy to remember what features you added when and track any
potential bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Github, you can do this on a globally cooperative scale. I often wondered how open source software worked because in my
office we couldn't have two people editing a file at the same time or else it would override all changes the other had made.
This always seemed like an unavoidable problem, something we all just had to work around. But when I read about Github, I
was so impressed! Finally, a way for people to be working on the same file at the same time without the danger of overriding
others' work. Github's complex but necessary system of ensuring that no unnecessary changes get
made to the master file is great. It will store a master version for you, and you can use branches to ensure that any changes
made don't effect the master file until you are ready. It's an amazingly powerful service.

     This video made me even more excited to be a part of the DBC experience. I already had an idea of the what Karim calls the Kitchen mindset before,
but I think he really made it clear what the difference is between feeling like you are a part of something bigger vs. feeling like you are
a consumer of goods. I have always responded well to an "all in it together" mindset. It's always been my favorite part of a job or a project.
I loved participating in the theater program in my high school because it truly felt like we were all in it together and everyone must do what they
can to make the production the best it can be. I have realized lately that the problems in my education have stemmed from a lack of this mindset.
Not just in lecture classes where the expectation is to consume what you ordered from the menu and move along, but in small discussion courses too.
The teacher may not be serving us knowledge in that case, but the self- stratification of fellow students made it difficult to feel an comeraderie.
    </p>
    <p>

This brings in the other point Karim makes about the two fears of people coming into Dev Bootcamp. They are either afraid of not performing
as well as the other students and dragging others down, or performing much better than the other students and dragging others along. I was
keenly aware of being in the first camp in college, which was also a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is exciting to know that DBC is a culture
which understands and allows for both fears. I feel like the problems in a college discussion course of students stratifying themselves in
this way is the responsibility of the teacher to curtail that behavior and make sure that everyone is equal. I am excited to hear that DBC
values this equality so highly and works to fight against both the imposter syndrome and a destructive overconfidence.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am so excited to spend the next few months working with people who share these values and strive for these ideals. I will confess,
it makes me nervous too. I have not always been very effective at knowing exactly when imposter syndrome comes into play in my life, nor
when I slip into a consumer mindset. I feel confident, though, that DBC will help me be more aware of these things and better able to
change them.
