    <p>In my (admittedly limited) exploration of the Ruby language, it has become increasingly important to clarify the difference and significance of both Arrays and Hashes. They are two very different ways of storing information.</p>
    <p>Arrays are for storing lists. An array might store all the names on a basketball team. An array might store several multiples of five. Or all the appetizers on the Sunday menu. It can be a collection of anything (including more arrays), but in essence it is a list. In Ruby specifically, arrays are noted in this format:</p>
    <blockquote>Array = ["item1", 2, "three", 4 ]</blockquote>
    <p>Notice that the items in an array do not need to be in any specific format. In order for many methods to be performed on an array, they will need to be in the same format, but an array needn't have any uniformity by itself.</p>
    <p>You can also find things within an Array. If you ask the program to find the fifth thing in the array, it will do so, but the numbering is a little odd. It actually begins at 0 and continues on. So technically if you want to find the fifth thing, you must specify the fourth since the first was counted as zero. This feature is called the "index" of the array.</p>
    <p>Hashes, however, are very different. Hashes store things in pairs called "Key: Value" pairs. An example of a hash might be a set of novels and their authors. Or perhaps a set of pizza places and your favorite pizzas at each. It could also be a set of personal information about a client. It has many uses, but it is not in any necessary order, nor is it searchable by anything other than it's keys or values.</p>
    <blockquote><pre>In Ruby, a hash looks like this:
    My_info = { name: "Blanche",
    username: "Alita42",
    age: 30,
    blog: "I Made Satan Cry",
      }</pre></blockquote>
      <p>So you could search this by the key "age" which would then return the integer 30. You could also search value "I Made Satan Cry" and get the key "blog".</p>
    <p>Anyway, these things are very useful for I'm sure a myriad of things but I must confess that I am well out of time for the evening. I hope that this information was helpful for you.</p>

    <p>When I took the Gregorc Thinking Styles quiz, I found out I had an "Abstract Random" thinking style and I thought "Well that explains that."Not that I had any idea what it means, of course. I had to go look that up. But the phrase "Abstract Random" just seemed to sum me up.</p>
      <p>When I looked it up I found several statements that seemed to describe me. "Dislikes routine and orderliness." "Is stretched by attending to details and giving exact answers." "Tends to prefer a noncompetitive atmosphere." These are all true statements about me.</p>
      <p>The term "abstract random" comes from a combination of what the Gregorc theory calls a perception and an ordering ability. My strongest perception style being abstract and my strongest ordering ability being random. This means that I perceive by using hidding meandings and connections. I like to consider or imagine things I may not be able to see. This is all evidenced by my interests in mythology and symbolism. Also probably encouraged by my insistence upon reading sci-fi and fantasy novels.</p>
      <p>The "random" ordering ability is a little harder for me to understand. The literature characterizes this as organizing information in chunks, and being able to start a project somewhere in the middle and produce the same desired results. I mean, I guess the chunks thing is fairly accurate. I definitely learn best in short spurts - like drinking bubble tea. Most of the time it's the tea, but sometimes I get this whole chunk of tapioca and I just GET IT, whatever IT is. I guess I can see now where this "random" thing is coming from.</p>
      <p>We were also asked to reflect on Carol Dweck's fixed and growth mindsets. It's funny, in my old life I remember asking Dr. Carol Dweck to peer review one of the faculty members in the Psych department I used to work for. I think she also came to give a talk at our department.</p>
      <p>Anyway, I feel that I've struggeled a lot with a growth vs. fixed mindset. When I read more of Dweck's work on the subject it really seemed like I was much more in the growth mindset. However, my biggest struggles have been from being fixed. I really don't handle change well. It takes me a long time to feel comfortable in a new situation. In general, I DO avoid challenges and I do give up easily.</p>
      <p>But these were all things I intended to try to change about myself by signing up for Dev Bootcamp. I want to be better at adapting and accepting challenges. I want to DO something and not give myself the option of giving up if it got too hard. I want to be the me with a growth mindset who CAN do.</p>
      <p>To that end, I think keeping both my "Abstract Random" learning/thinking style in mind along with a growth mindset will help me. I must remember that I need to slow down a little and to accept that I'm going to need to order information into little tapioca balls in the straw of mind (take THAT James Joyce). And my random symbolic connections are to be accepted, not fought against. I also need to remember that change is most often good. If not immediately then eventually. I think I can manage all that.

    <p>When writing HTML code it is often useful to have two of the same element look and act differently. We can change their behavior in CSS, but the stylesheet needs to know which element you want to behave in which way. Thus, you give the two elements different attributes you can call in the stylesheet. There are two different attributes you can use for this. They are id and class. </p>
<p>Ids are best used as a way to pinpoint a single individual element. The attributes given to it in the stylesheet will only be applied to that specific element.</p>
<p>example: If you want all the text in one section to be centered, but not anywhere else, this is the code you would use.
<blockquote>"html:
<div id="example"></div>"
css:
#example {
text-align:center
}"</blockquote></p>
<p>If you would like several elements to behave similarly, you would use the class attribute. This way, you would only have to call the attribute once in the stylesheet and have all of your changes apply to all of the selected elements.</p>

<p>example: If you want all of your sections to have a grey background, this is the code you would use:
<blockquote>html:
<section class="example">
</section>
css:
.section {
background-color: grey
}</blockquote></p>
<p>Though technically, you could use these interchangeably, these are the best practices associated with each attribute. It saves code, time and effort. In order to not be defining every element individually, you would use the class attribute. If you only need one element to behave a specific way, you should use the id attribute. The name in quotes need not be anything in particular, just something you may remember and won't be confused for some other html or css command. You could give them all names of dead Presidents, and they would work just as well. </p>

      When I found out what version control was, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Writing papers and creative writing pieces
 in college (it was my minor), I would have several different versions of the same file, each with a different filename
(often something like Shakespeare Paper 1, Shakespeare Paper 2), and I could never easily tell what
the difference was between them. If I had been able to use Git to control those versions, my life would have been much
easier. Every time you commmit changes to a file, git asks you to make a commit message, summarizing the changes made.
All the changes are named and packaged with the file so that you can easily navigate between versions and track edits made.
This is particularly beneficial for programming. It makes it easy to remember what features you added when and track any
potential bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
        With Github, you can do this on a globally cooperative scale. I often wondered how open source software worked because in my
office we couldn't have two people editing a file at the same time or else it would override all changes the other had made.
This always seemed like an unavoidable problem, something we all just had to work around. But when I read about Github, I
was so impressed! Finally, a way for people to be working on the same file at the same time without the danger of overriding
others' work. Github's complex but necessary system of ensuring that no unnecessary changes get
made to the master file is great. It will store a master version for you, and you can use branches to ensure that any changes
made don't effect the master file until you are ready. It's an amazingly powerful service.

     This video made me even more excited to be a part of the DBC experience. I already had an idea of the what Karim calls the Kitchen mindset before,
but I think he really made it clear what the difference is between feeling like you are a part of something bigger vs. feeling like you are
a consumer of goods. I have always responded well to an "all in it together" mindset. It's always been my favorite part of a job or a project.
I loved participating in the theater program in my high school because it truly felt like we were all in it together and everyone must do what they
can to make the production the best it can be. I have realized lately that the problems in my education have stemmed from a lack of this mindset.
Not just in lecture classes where the expectation is to consume what you ordered from the menu and move along, but in small discussion courses too.
The teacher may not be serving us knowledge in that case, but the self- stratification of fellow students made it difficult to feel an comeraderie.
    </p>
    <p>

This brings in the other point Karim makes about the two fears of people coming into Dev Bootcamp. They are either afraid of not performing
as well as the other students and dragging others down, or performing much better than the other students and dragging others along. I was
keenly aware of being in the first camp in college, which was also a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is exciting to know that DBC is a culture
which understands and allows for both fears. I feel like the problems in a college discussion course of students stratifying themselves in
this way is the responsibility of the teacher to curtail that behavior and make sure that everyone is equal. I am excited to hear that DBC
values this equality so highly and works to fight against both the imposter syndrome and a destructive overconfidence.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am so excited to spend the next few months working with people who share these values and strive for these ideals. I will confess,
it makes me nervous too. I have not always been very effective at knowing exactly when imposter syndrome comes into play in my life, nor
when I slip into a consumer mindset. I feel confident, though, that DBC will help me be more aware of these things and better able to
change them.
