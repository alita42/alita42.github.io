            <p>Education:
              I attended a French immersion elementary school and thereby was forever confused about how many quarts in a gallon and how many feet in a mile.
              I attended a small, private middle school that indirectly taught me the value of economic, cultural, racial diversity in educational environments and how very important it is to acknowledge and accept one's truest self.
              I attended a public magnet prep school for high school that taught me that some of the greatest lessons can be taught through fiction.
              I attended a small Quaker liberal arts college and learned the intersectionality of political and social issues.
              I watched as my mother opened a bakery and that taught me that anything is possible at any age through dedication and a fair amount of perspiration.
              In my first career at a huge academic institution, I learned the unknowable value of academic research and the often-overlooked staff that helps make it possible.
              I attended a short intensive program exploring my emotional limitations and how to manage my internal life - through which I learned the absolute value of my self.
              I am in the process of attending an intensive Web Development education program where I will not only learn front and back-end programming, but exactly where my stress limits are and use my newfound skills to manage myself.</p>

            <p>Skills:
              I can express myself in writing fairly well. I have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of HTML and Ruby, and a working knowledge of CSS and JavaScript. I am experienced in acounting, bookkeeping and the basics of budget projections. I am trained in various internal systems used by the local Big Ten university. I am skilled at keeping precious friends.</p>

          <p>Real talk:
            I am a single, white female with a playful and grey cat who loves me. I live in the Midwest, USA and love it. I read feminist pop culture commentary for fun and I also like to go to the local bar's goth nights. I was born in the mid-80s and soon identified strongly with the 90s. I remember 9/11 as that surreal Physics class where the teacher wouldn't stop talking about who-knows-what even after the loudspeaker announcement that sent chills down my spine. I've read both "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" and "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man" and they were equally formative. I'm not very good at advertising myself because I always start talking/writing like this. In some poetic, all-encompasing tone exhibited by snippets of personal realities. I guess this is just how I roll.</p>
